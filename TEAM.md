I founded Made4web S.A.S. following a career as a Network Specialist. I needed a new challenge to put my skills to the test and was lucky enough to create a successful company with customers in both the public and private sectors.

I now have 14 years of experience running the company including 3 years of experience in the crypto space (especially as a delegate of many DPOS projects) so am confident my team and I can rise to the challenge of working in and promoting the wider TRON ecosystem.
