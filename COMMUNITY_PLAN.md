The Italian Crypto Ecosystem is very well established and organised. The main centers are Turin, Milan and Rome, we have already organised crypto meetings in all 3 cities with good feedback and have plans for conferences whose contents will be to explain TRON and its great potential. Our meetup average is around 200 - 300 attendees.


Our Social Media and chat based activities are supported by individuals with a wide array of backgrounds, including developers, investors, speculators or simply the curious. Our focus is to create interest within the Italian Tron Community (ex Italian TRON Telegram chat count was more than 1k members) and increase awareness with public events, promotional activities including contests, charity donations and TRON/TrIP branded merchandise. We will also involve the Italian DPOS Dev community and help them realise products that will increase the real world applications of TRX and promote the wider TRON ecosystem.


Social activities are also important as they allow us to expand our audience. We intend to run Twitter accounts in multiple languages and utilise Instagram ensuring all teams can communicate and promote meetups effectively; we expect to have around 2.5 - 3k users (Italian language) by end of the year. 

We will make use of radio and paper based media to increase general awareness of the TRON ecosystem, especially for those unaware of the crypto universe and its great benefits. Currently in Italy the media only covers Bitcoin.
